## 🧠 About the Project

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to make perfect decisions in a simple game like Tic Tac Toe. The AI never loses – it always picks the optimal move using **Minimax**, a popular decision-making algorithm in game theory.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ GUI-based interface using `Tkinter`
- 🤖 AI logic using **Minimax** (Unbeatable!)
- 💬 Message boxes to display win/draw results
- 🔁 Automatic reset after each game
- 🧠 Easy to understand and modify for learning AI

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are needed – uses only built-in Python modules (`tkinter`, `math`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### Step 1: Save the code in a Python file, for example:

```bash
tic_tac_toe.py
