## 📚 Overview

This repository contains three AI-powered Python game projects developed during my AI course. Each game implements real AI logic such as **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to simulate intelligent gameplay.

## 1️⃣ 🧠 Tic Tac Toe AI (Minimax)

### 🎮 Description:
A classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game built using `tkinter`. You play as `X` while the computer (AI) plays as `O`, powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

### 🛠 Features:
- Built with **Tkinter GUI**
- AI logic uses Minimax to choose the best move
- Win, draw, and reset detection
- Simple and intuitive user interface

### ▶️ How to Run:
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```bash
# ♟️ Chess Game with AI (Minimax + Alpha-Beta + Pygame)

This is a GUI-based **Chess Game** where the player (White) plays against an **AI-powered computer opponent (Black)**. The game is built using **Pygame** for the GUI and **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** for the AI's decision-making logic.


## 🧠 Features

- 🔢 AI logic using **Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning**
- 🎯 Evaluates positions based on **material balance**
- 📦 Built using `python-chess` and `pygame`
- 👆 Mouse interaction to select and move pieces
- ⚡ Basic pawn promotion support
- 📘 Displays winner (Player/Computer/Draw) at game end

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`pygame`](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
- [`python-chess`](https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame python-chess



# 🎮 Connect Four – Player vs AI (Minimax + Alpha-Beta)

A Python-based **Connect Four** game where the user competes against an **AI opponent** powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

Built with:
- `pygame` – for graphical interface and interaction
- `numpy` – for efficient board management and numerical operations
- `math` and `random` – for core game logic

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 Choose to go first (Red) or let AI go first (Yellow)
- ♟️ Real-time visual interaction using mouse and keyboard
- 🧮 AI uses **Minimax** (depth = 5) with **Alpha-Beta pruning** for efficient move selection
- 📊 Score evaluation considers rows, columns, and diagonals
- ✅ Option to **play again** after game ends
- 🎨 Clean visual interface using `pygame`

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame`
- `numpy`

### 🔧 Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
